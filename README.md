# Smart Mathods Face Detection

Use OpenCV to make a real time face detection

Fisrt, I have downloaded the python3.9 from https://www.python.org/downloads.
Then I have installed the opencv using the command Prompt by typing " pip install opencv-python"
I also downloaded visual Studio Code editor in ordere to write and edit the code from https://code.visualstudio.com/. 

Now there are tow python files one is "detect_face_video.py" where it will display 
a reatime window in which will detect any faces there. To run it open the command Promp and the copy the folder path in ordere to access it by using "cd file path" command.
Then, simply run the file by typing "python detect_face_video.py" command. I didn't take any screenshot because I can't share my face but please try it. 

the other file "detect_face_image.py" is for loading an image and then detect the  image faces. You can load any image and then only change the image name in this command.

After that, run it simply by typing "python detect_face_image.py" and it will display the image with it's faces detect as shown.
